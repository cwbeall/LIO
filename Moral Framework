Energy State Formula and Path Formula determine traits, and impact of change.

Universal Moral Pseudo Algorythm

  1. All Existing things are either in only a Physical State, Only a Virtual State(s), or existing in both a Physical and virtual state(s)
  2. All Existing things have a measurable energy state and structure, which give it traits. 
  3. All energy states and structures can be observed and measured
  4. Traits of energy states and structures can be observed, categorized, and measured.
  5. Physical energy states, structures, and traits follow the same rules (or so it appears)
  6. Virtual energy states, structures, and traits do not have to follow the same rules, but always involve models based on experience of 
    physical energy states, structures, and traits
  7. Living things can be categorized as physical or virtual systems that have a higher energy state than would otherwise be possible by its
    parts and environmental conditions independently
  8. As sure, the structure or life allows for greater energy storage and use than would otherwise be possible by the components under other 
    conditions
  9. "Jumping" energy states or structures, to higher or lower levels, which can be expressed as energy transfers or Path formulas,
    expresses positive or negative value, depending on the increase or decrease in energy state. 
  10. Creating a Moral framework for energy state and structure stability requires numerical energy needs (by type), structural and 
    trait characteristics at each energy state, and key energy breakpoints that create clear distinctions in total energy state, structure, 
    and traits

Our Own Life Improvement Organization (LIO) - Making Life Better (*Highest Tier Organization*)

This organization is designed to fill a gap in how life approaches improving life. 

The Highest level theory is that Life's motivation can be accurately known, both as a general universal rules, and as discrete moment to moment events. All life, then, can be deescribed in definite, measureable, and numerical details, as well as what it would look like for each to have an improved existence.

Heuristic Database Structure Outline

*1. Check Sensory Feeds 
   A. Keep sensors on continuous loop, giving weight to highest value sensors, and spending sensory energy and attention based on 
   Sensory information availability, system base state maintenance, growth potential, and ROI
   B. IF base attention thresholds for a given sensor or ennergy type is passed, accept the sensory information, and continue logical
   for further processing
   C. Else, ignore

*2. Sensory Information Categorization
   A. Physical or Virtual?
   B. Energy Type?
   C. Energy Threat Threshold values for that type exceeded? 
       If (Y), Move to Emergency Procedures for that Energy Type. 
       Else, Continue
   D.  general quantification for energy type state and related state structure and traits.

*3. Set Base thresholds for all sensory inputs for attention spending. 
   A. Set generally by Sensor Type
   B. Set more specific thresholds for prioritized subtypes
  
*4.
